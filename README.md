# Pig-Dice
A console game with rolling two six-sided dices to achieve 100 points earlier than adversary. 

# What
In the game of Pig Dice, players take turns rolling two six-sided dice. On a player’s turn, they can roll the dice repeatedly until they either choose to hold (stop rolling) or 
roll a 1. As long as the player keeps rolling without getting a 1 on either die, the numbers on the dice are added to the player’s turn score. At any point, a player can hold, 
which takes their turn score and permanently adds it to their overall score. If they roll a 1 on either die, they lose all of the points they had collected in their turn score, 
nothing extra is added to their overall score, and it becomes the next player’s turn. When a player’s overall score reaches 100, the game ends, and they have won. The game allows
up to 4 players.
